# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: April 25, 2025**

Wander (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share your information when you use Wander, a social media app where an AI generates questions, including location-based questions, for you to answer, creating posts visible to other users. By using Wander, you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the app.

## 1. Information We Collect
We collect information to provide, improve, and secure Wander. The types of information include:

### a. Information You Provide
- **Account Information**: Email address, username, and password when you create an account.
- **User-Generated Content**: Responses to AI-generated questions, posts, comments, likes, and profile details (e.g., bio, profile picture).
- **Reports and Feedback**: Reports you submit about objectionable content (e.g., hate speech, harassment) and feedback on AI questions or app features.
- **Communications**: Information you share when contacting our support team.

### b. Automatically Collected Information
- **Location Data**: With your permission, we collect your precise or approximate location (e.g., GPS, IP address, or Wi-Fi data) to generate contextually relevant AI questions (e.g., questions about local events or culture).
- **Device Information**: Device type, operating system (e.g., iOS), IP address, and browser type.
- **Usage Data**: Interactions with the app, such as pages visited, features used (e.g., posting, commenting), and session duration.
- **Analytics**: Aggregated, anonymized data on app performance and user behavior, collected via tools like Firebase Analytics.

### c. Information from Third Parties
- If you sign in using Apple, Google, or another third-party service, we may receive limited information (e.g., email address, name) based on your authorization.

## 2. How We Use Your Information
We use your information to operate and enhance Wander, including:
- Delivering core features, such as generating AI questions (including location-based questions), displaying posts, and enabling comments or likes.
- Moderating content to enforce our Terms and Conditions and Community Guidelines.
- Processing reports and responding to support inquiries.
- Personalizing your experience (e.g., tailoring AI questions to your interests or location, if you opt in).
- Analyzing usage patterns to improve app functionality and performance.
- Complying with legal obligations, such as responding to lawful requests from authorities.

## 3. Location Data Usage
- **Purpose**: We use your location data to generate contextually relevant AI questions (e.g., “What’s your favorite local cafe?” based on your city). Location data enhances the relevance of questions but is not required to use Wander.
- **Consent**: We collect location data only with your explicit permission, requested via iOS permission prompts. You can deny or revoke access at any time (see Section 6).
- **Scope**: Location data is used solely for question generation and personalization, not for advertising or third-party sharing unless specified.
- **Anonymization**: When used for analytics or AI training (with consent), location data is anonymized to prevent identification.

## 4. AI Data Usage
- **AI Training**: Your responses to AI-generated questions and, if permitted, location data may be used to improve our AI’s question-generation capabilities, but only if you explicitly opt in via the app’s settings.
- **Opt-Out**: You can disable AI training at any time in the settings, and we will exclude your data (including location data) from future training.
- **Anonymization**: Data used for AI training is anonymized and aggregated to protect your identity.
- **Transparency**: We do not use your responses or location data for purposes beyond improving Wander’s AI unless you consent.

## 5. Sharing Your Information
We share your information only in limited circumstances:
- **Service Providers**: With trusted third-party vendors (e.g., cloud storage, analytics, content moderation tools) who process data, including location data, on our behalf under strict confidentiality agreements.
- **Legal Requirements**: With law enforcement or regulators if required by law or to protect user safety or public interest.
- **Business Transfers**: In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your data, including location data, may be transferred, but we will notify you beforehand and provide options where possible.

We do not sell your personal information, including location data, to third parties for marketing or other purposes.

## 6. Your Choices and Controls
You have control over your data through the following options:
- **Location Data**: Manage location access via iOS settings or Wander’s privacy settings. You can deny, limit to approximate location, or revoke permission at any time, and Wander will stop collecting location data.
- **Account Deletion**: Delete your account via the app’s settings to remove your posts, comments, location data, and personal data from our databases, subject to legal retention periods (e.g., for compliance with law enforcement requests).
- **Post Deletion**: Delete individual posts at any time using the “Delete” button, with immediate removal from public view.
- **AI Training Opt-Out**: Disable the use of your responses and location data for AI training in the settings.
- **Marketing Preferences**: Opt out of promotional emails using the unsubscribe link or app settings.
- **Tracking**: Manage analytics tracking via the app’s privacy settings. Note that we do not currently respond to browser Do Not Track signals.

## 7. Data Storage and Security
- **Storage**: Your data, including location data, is stored on secure servers in the USA, protected with industry-standard encryption (e.g., AES-256 for data at rest, TLS for data in transit).
- **Security Measures**: We use firewalls, access controls, and regular security audits to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Limitations**: While we take reasonable steps to safeguard your data, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## 8. International Data Transfers
- Your data, including location data, may be transferred to and stored in the USA or other countries with different privacy laws than your jurisdiction.
- For EU users, we use Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) to ensure GDPR-compliant data transfers, protecting your rights under EU law.

## 9. Children’s Privacy
- Wander is not intended for children under 13 (or 16 in the EU, per GDPR). We do not knowingly collect data, including location data, from users under these age limits.
- If we discover data from an underage user, we will delete it promptly. Contact us at quinn@wander.one to report such cases.
- For users under 18, parental consent is required during signup, verified via email confirmation.

## 10. Third-Party Links and Services
- Wander may include links to third-party websites or services (e.g., support forums on www.wander.one). We are not responsible for their privacy practices.
- Review the privacy policies of third-party services before engaging with them.

## 11. Changes to This Privacy Policy
- We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect changes in our practices or legal requirements.
- Significant updates will be communicated via in-app notifications or email to your registered address.
- Continued use of Wander after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

- **GDPR (EU Residents)**: Right to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your data, request portability, and object to certain uses (e.g., location-based personalization).
