# Community Guidelines

**Last Updated: April 25, 2025**

Welcome to Wander, a social media platform where an AI generates questions, including those based on your location, for you to answer, creating posts that others can see, like, and comment on. Our Community Guidelines (“Guidelines”) ensure that Wander remains a safe, respectful, and inclusive space for everyone. By using Wander, you agree to follow these Guidelines, our [Terms and Conditions](https://www.wander.one/terms), and our [Privacy Policy](https://www.wander.one/privacy). Failure to comply may result in content removal, account suspension, or termination.

## 1. Our Commitment to Community
Wander is a place to share ideas, connect through creative responses, and engage with others’ stories. We encourage open expression but prioritize safety and respect. These Guidelines apply to all content you create or share, including posts, comments, profiles, and feedback.

## 2. What’s Allowed
We welcome content that:
- Reflects thoughtful, authentic responses to AI-generated questions.
- Fosters positive engagement, such as sharing local experiences or creative ideas.
- Respects diverse perspectives and celebrates inclusivity.

## 3. What’s Not Allowed
To keep Wander safe, we prohibit content or behavior that:
- **Harassment and Bullying**: Includes targeted insults, threats, or intimidation based on race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or other protected characteristics.
- **Hate Speech**: Promotes violence, discrimination, or hostility against individuals or groups based on protected characteristics.
- **Sexually Explicit Content**: Includes nudity, pornography, or graphic sexual material.
- **Violence and Threats**: Depicts, promotes, or incites violence, self-harm, or harm to others.
- **Misinformation**: Spreads false or misleading information that risks harm (e.g., health misinformation, election fraud claims).
- **Illegal Activities**: Encourages or depicts illegal behavior, such as drug trafficking or copyright infringement.
- **Spam and Manipulation**: Includes repetitive, misleading, or automated content (e.g., bots, fake accounts).
- **Impersonation**: Pretends to be someone else or misrepresents your identity.
- **Privacy Violations**: Shares personal information (e.g., addresses, phone numbers) without consent.

## 4. How We Enforce These Guidelines
We use a combination of automated tools and human moderators to ensure compliance:
- **Content Moderation**: AI filters scan posts, comments, and profiles in real time for prohibited content, with human review for flagged items within 24–48 hours.
- **Reporting**: Use the “Report” button on posts, comments, or profiles to flag violations (e.g., hate speech, harassment). Select a reason for clarity, and we’ll review within 48 hours, notifying you of the outcome.
- **Blocking**: Block users via the “Block” button to prevent interaction or visibility. Blocking is immediate and reversible in settings.
- **Content Removal**: We remove violating content and may issue warnings, temporary suspensions, or permanent bans.
- **Strike System**: Three violations within 90 days lead to a 7-day suspension; further violations may result in account termination.
- **Appeals**: If you believe we made an error, appeal moderation decisions by emailing quinn@wander.one. Appeals are reviewed within 72 hours.

## 5. Your Role in the Community
Help us keep Wander safe and welcoming by:
- **Posting Responsibly**: Ensure your responses to AI questions (including location-based ones) align with these Guidelines.
- **Reporting Violations**: Flag harmful content using the “Report” button to protect the community.
- **Respecting Others**: Engage with kindness, even when disagreeing.
- **Deleting Content**: Remove your own posts if they no longer reflect your intentions, using the “Delete” button for immediate removal.

## 6. AI-Generated Questions
- Our AI creates questions, sometimes using your location (with permission), to spark engaging posts. Questions aim to be safe and relevant, but you can:
  - Skip any question you don’t want to answer.
  - Provide feedback via the app or quinn@wander.one to improve question quality.
- Your responses may be used to refine the AI, but only with your consent (see Privacy Policy, Section 4).

## 7. Location-Based Content
- If you share location data, your posts may reflect local context (e.g., mentioning your city). Keep posts general to protect your privacy (e.g., avoid sharing exact addresses).
- Report any location-based content that feels invasive or unsafe.

## 8. Updates to These Guidelines
We may update these Guidelines to reflect new features or legal requirements. Significant changes will be announced via in-app notifications or email. Continued use of Wander constitutes acceptance.

## 9. Contact Us
For questions, reports, or feedback about these Guidelines, contact:
- **Email**: quinn@wander.one
- **Website**: www.wander.one

We respond to inquiries within 24–48 hours.

## 10. Our Commitment
Wander is dedicated to fostering a community where everyone feels safe to express themselves. We enforce these Guidelines fairly and transparently, balancing free expression with user safety.
