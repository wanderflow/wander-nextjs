# Terms and Conditions

**Last Updated: April 25, 2025**

Welcome to Wander, a social media platform where an AI generates questions for users to answer, creating posts that can be viewed by others. By using Wander, you agree to these Terms and Conditions (“Terms”). If you do not agree, please do not use the app.

## 1. Acceptance of Terms
By accessing or using Wander, you confirm that you are at least 13 years old (or 16 in the EU, per GDPR) and agree to be bound by these Terms and our Privacy Policy. If you are under 18, you must have parental consent to use the app.

## 2. User Conduct
You agree to use Wander responsibly and in compliance with all applicable laws. You must not:
- Post or share content that is unlawful, defamatory, harassing, hateful, sexually explicit, violent, or otherwise objectionable, as determined by Wander.
- Engage in bullying, harassment, or discrimination based on race, gender, religion, or other protected characteristics.
- Impersonate others or create false accounts.
- Share content that infringes on intellectual property, privacy, or other rights.
- Use the app to distribute spam, malware, or other harmful material.

## 3. User-Generated Content
- **Posts**: Your responses to AI-generated questions become posts visible to other users. You retain ownership of your content but grant Wander a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to display, store, and distribute your posts within the app.
- **Deletion**: You may delete your posts at any time via the app’s interface. Deleted posts will be removed from public view and our databases, subject to legal retention requirements.
- **Moderation**: We reserve the right to review, remove, or restrict content that violates these Terms or Community Guidelines. We use automated tools and human moderators to monitor content.

## 4. Reporting and Blocking
- **Reporting**: You can report objectionable content (e.g., hate speech, harassment) using the “Report” button on posts, comments, or profiles. Reports are reviewed within 48 hours, and you may be notified of the outcome.
- **Blocking**: You can block other users to prevent them from interacting with you or viewing your content. Blocked users will not be notified.

## 5. AI-Generated Questions
- The AI generates questions to engage users. We strive to ensure questions are safe and appropriate but cannot guarantee they will always meet your preferences.
- You may skip questions or provide feedback to improve the AI’s prompts.
- Your responses may be used to refine the AI’s question-generation, but only with your consent (see Privacy Policy).

## 6. Account Termination
We may suspend or terminate your account if you:
- Repeatedly violate these Terms or Community Guidelines.
- Engage in illegal or harmful behavior.
- Attempt to bypass moderation or security measures.
You may delete your account at any time via the app’s settings.

## 7. Intellectual Property
Wander, including its AI, design, and content (excluding user posts), is owned by Wander. You may not copy, modify, or distribute our intellectual property without permission.

## 8. Limitation of Liability
Wander is provided “as is.” We are not liable for:
- User-generated content or interactions.
- Technical issues, data loss, or service interruptions.
- Any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from your use of the app.

## 9. Changes to Terms
We may update these Terms at any time. We will notify you of significant changes via the app or email. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.
