      <h2>4. How We Enforce These Guidelines</h2>
      <p>
        We use a combination of automated tools and human moderators to ensure
        compliance:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Content Moderation</strong>: AI filters scan posts, comments,
          and profiles in real time for prohibited content, with human review
          for flagged items within 24–48 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reporting</strong>: Use the "Report" button on posts,
          comments, or profiles to flag violations (e.g., hate speech,
          harassment). Select a reason for clarity, and we'll review within 48
          hours, notifying you of the outcome.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Blocking</strong>: Block users via the "Block" button to
          prevent interaction or visibility. Blocking is immediate and
          reversible in settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Content Removal</strong>: We remove violating content and may
          issue warnings, temporary suspensions, or permanent bans.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Strike System</strong>: Three violations within 90 days lead
          to a 7-day suspension; further violations may result in account
          termination.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Appeals</strong>: If you believe we made an error, appeal
          moderation decisions by emailing quinn@wander.one. Appeals are
          reviewed within 72 hours.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. Your Role in the Community</h2>
      <p>Help us keep Wander safe and welcoming by:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Posting Responsibly</strong>: Ensure your responses to AI
          questions (including location-based ones) align with these Guidelines.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reporting Violations</strong>: Flag harmful content using the
          "Report" button to protect the community.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Respecting Others</strong>: Engage with kindness, even when
          disagreeing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Deleting Content</strong>: Remove your own posts if they no
          longer reflect your intentions, using the "Delete" button for
          immediate removal.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. AI-Generated Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Our AI creates questions, sometimes using your location (with
          permission), to spark engaging posts. Questions aim to be safe and
          relevant, but you can:
          <ul>
            <li>Skip any question you don't want to answer.</li>
            <li>
              Provide feedback via the app or quinn@wander.one to improve
              question quality.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Your responses may be used to refine the AI, but only with your
          consent (see Privacy Policy, Section 4).
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>7. Location-Based Content</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you share location data, your posts may reflect local context
          (e.g., mentioning your city). Keep posts general to protect your
          privacy (e.g., avoid sharing exact addresses).
        </li>
        <li>
          Report any location-based content that feels invasive or unsafe.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Updates to These Guidelines</h2>
      <p>
        We may update these Guidelines to reflect new features or legal
        requirements. Significant changes will be announced via in-app
        notifications or email. Continued use of Wander constitutes acceptance.
