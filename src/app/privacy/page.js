        answer, creating posts visible to other users. By using Wander, you
        agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please do not use the
        app.
      </p>

          likes.
        </li>
        <li>

      <h2>3. Location Data Usage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Purpose</strong>: We use your location data to generate
          contextually relevant AI questions (e.g., "What's your favorite local
          cafe?" based on your city). Location data enhances the relevance of
          questions but is not required to use Wander.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Consent</strong>: We collect location data only with your
          explicit permission, requested via iOS permission prompts. You can
          deny or revoke access at any time (see Section 6).
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Scope</strong>: Location data is used solely for question
          generation and personalization, not for advertising or third-party
          sharing unless specified.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Anonymization</strong>: When used for analytics or AI training
          (with consent), location data is anonymized to prevent identification.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. AI Data Usage</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>AI Training</strong>: Your responses to AI-generated questions
          and, if permitted, location data may be used to improve our AI's
          question-generation capabilities, but only if you explicitly opt in
          via the app's settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Opt-Out</strong>: You can disable AI training at any time in
          the settings, and we will exclude your data (including location data)
          from future training.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Anonymization</strong>: Data used for AI training is
          anonymized and aggregated to protect your identity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Transparency</strong>: We do not use your responses or
          location data for purposes beyond improving Wander's AI unless you
          consent.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Service Providers</strong>: With trusted third-party vendors
          (e.g., cloud storage, analytics, content moderation tools) who process
          data, including location data, on our behalf under strict
          confidentiality agreements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Requirements</strong>: With law enforcement or
          regulators if required by law or to protect user safety or public
          interest.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Business Transfers</strong>: In the event of a merger,
          acquisition, or asset sale, your data, including location data, may be
          transferred, but we will notify you beforehand and provide options
          where possible.
        </li>
