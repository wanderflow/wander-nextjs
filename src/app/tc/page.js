      <p>
        Welcome to Wander, a social media platform where an AI generates
        questions for users to answer, creating posts that can be viewed by
        others. By using Wander, you agree to these Terms and Conditions
        ("Terms"). If you do not agree, please do not use the app.
      </p>

      </ul>

      <h2>3. User-Generated Content</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Posts</strong>: Your responses to AI-generated questions
          become posts visible to other users. You retain ownership of your
          content but grant Wander a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free
          license to display, store, and distribute your posts within the app.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Deletion</strong>: You may delete your posts at any time via
          the app's interface. Deleted posts will be removed from public view
          and our databases, subject to legal retention requirements.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Moderation</strong>: We reserve the right to review, remove,
          or restrict content that violates these Terms or Community Guidelines.
          We use automated tools and human moderators to monitor content.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>4. Reporting and Blocking</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Reporting</strong>: You can report objectionable content
          (e.g., hate speech, harassment) using the "Report" button on posts,
          comments, or profiles. Reports are reviewed within 48 hours, and you
          may be notified of the outcome.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Blocking</strong>: You can block other users to prevent them
          from interacting with you or viewing your content. Blocked users will
          not be notified.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>5. AI-Generated Questions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The AI generates questions to engage users. We strive to ensure

          You may skip questions or provide feedback to improve the AI's
          prompts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Your responses may be used to refine the AI's question-generation, but

        </li>
      </ul>
